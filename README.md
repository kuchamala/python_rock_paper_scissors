Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
This is a simple Python program that lets you play the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.

How to Play
1. Open the rps_game.py file in your Python editor of choice.
2. Run the program.
3. Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) when prompted.
4. The computer will randomly generate a choice.
5.The program will determine the winner (or if it's a tie) based on the choices.
6. The result of the game will be displayed on the screen.
7. You will be asked if you want to play again. If you do, go back to step 3. If not, the program will exit.

Customization
If you want to add more choices to the game (such as "lizard" and "spock" from "The Big Bang Theory"), you can modify the choices list in the code. Just be sure to update the rules dictionary accordingly to include the new choices and their relationships to each other.
